    <h1 class = "headers"> WHAT IS CHRONIC RHINITIS? </h1>
    <p>About 58 million Americans have allergic rhinitis, which leads to symptoms such as sinusitis, or inflammation of the tissues that line the sinuses, eustachian tube dysfunction, ear infection, obstructive sleep apnea, and asthma. On the other hand, about 19 million have non-allergic rhinitis, which induces unpleasentries in the nose like postnasal drips, incessant runny noses and clogged stuffy noses, and violent sneezing. 
    
    Unfortunately, the implications of rhinitis do not stop at the symptoms. Both forms of rhinitis have been known to lead to loss of productivity at work, drowsiness, and increased, expensive, and frequent doctor visits.
