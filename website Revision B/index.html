                            is often used to mask the symptoms of rhinitis by temporarily suppressing the release of histamines within the body. Even if medication is successful in reducing the irritating effects of rhinitis, they must be constantly replenished, which can take a financial toll.

            We are a medical device company focused on developing
            the first in-office medical procedure for treating refractory 
            chronic rhinitis. Our ClariFixTM device will be used by 
            otolaryngologists, or ENT physicians, in a short, non-invasive 
            procedure under topical anesthesia to provide long lasting 
            relief from chronic rhinitis symptoms.

            <br></br>

            Here at Arrinex, we have developed a non-surgical means of eliminating rhinitis symptoms using cryotherapy that is as safe as it is effective. With the Arrinex solution, symptoms will be alleviated with a brief and painless procedure, and peace of mind will be restored for years to come. </p>
